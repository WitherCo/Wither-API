        <p class="date-updated">Last Updated: May 7, 2025</p>
        
        <div class="policy-section">
            <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
            <p>
                By accessing or using the Wither API Gateway services ("Services"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service 
                ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not access or use our Services.
            </p>
            <p>
                We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date 
                at the top of these Terms and, in some cases, we may provide additional notice. Your continued use of the Services 
                after such changes indicates your acceptance of the updated Terms.
            </p>
            
            <h2>2. Services Description</h2>
            <p>
                Wither API Gateway provides an integration hub for connecting to various APIs, services, and applications 
                through a unified interface. Our Services include API key management, webhook handling, email service 
                integration, and bot messaging capabilities.
            </p>
            
            <h2>3. Account Registration</h2>
            <p>
                To use certain features of our Services, you may be required to register for an account. You agree to provide 
                accurate, current, and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to 
                keep it accurate, current, and complete.
            </p>
            <p>
                You are responsible for safeguarding your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. 
                You must immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security.
            </p>
            
            <h2>4. API Keys and Authentication</h2>
            <p>
                You are responsible for all activities conducted through your API keys. Do not share your API keys with 
                unauthorized parties. We reserve the right to revoke API keys that are being misused or violate these Terms.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may create multiple API keys for different applications or purposes. Each API key should be treated as a 
                sensitive credential and protected accordingly. Regularly rotate your API keys as a security best practice.
            </p>
            
            <h2>5. Rate Limits and Fair Usage</h2>
            <p>
                Our Services implement rate limiting to ensure fair usage and service stability. Default rate limits are 
                set to 100 requests per hour, although these limits may be adjusted based on your specific needs and service tier.
            </p>
            <p>
                Attempting to circumvent rate limits, such as by creating multiple accounts or using automated tools to generate 
                excessive requests, is prohibited and may result in account suspension or termination.
            </p>
            
            <h2>6. Service Availability and Support</h2>
            <p>
                While we strive to provide reliable and consistent access to our Services, we do not guarantee uninterrupted 
                availability. We may occasionally need to perform maintenance, which could temporarily impact service availability.
